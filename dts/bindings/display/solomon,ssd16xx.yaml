    power-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: Power enable pin.

        This pin will be set to its active level to enable power to
        the display.

    reset-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: RESET pin.

        The RESET pin of SSD16XX is active low.
        If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured
        as active low.

    dc-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: DC pin.

        The DC pin of SSD16XX is active low (transmission command byte).
        If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured
        as active low.

    busy-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: BUSY pin.

        The BUSY pin of SSD16XX is active high.
        If connected directly the MCU pin should be configured
        as active high.

    tssv:

      description: Temperature Sensor Selection Value

        Display controller can have integrated temperature sensor or
        an external temperature sensor is connected to the controller.
        The value selects which sensor should be used.
